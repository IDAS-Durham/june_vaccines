# Data

The data is avaiable at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5520923). Download the ``safe_reopening_data.zip`` file and extract in a ``data/`` folder at this repo's root directory. The notebooks to plot the figures should then work out of the box.

Note that only summaries of the simulations are shared, and no full simulation results. These are large files, please contact carolina.cuesta-lazaro@durham.ac.uk to be granted access to full simulation outputs.
